#meetup discussion about The Branding of NEO Meetup Groups.

metachris - 02/25/2018
@Michael Herman (Toronto) in your repository you seem to copy the same content for a lot of meetups, and it seems to suggest "NEO Blockchain XXX" is the name to use. Please consult with the NEO team about this, we had some discussions about this exact topic for our Vienna Meetup, and the official response was that NEO prefers the meetups to be called "NEO Smart Economy Meetup XXX" rather than "Blockchain"

Michael Herman (Toronto) - 02/25/2018
You and I have discussed this before Chris.  On meetup.com, you need to choose a name that is discoverable.  In Toronto, we have dozens of blockchain meetup groups.  It would be suicide to create a blockchain meetup group that doesn't have "blockchain" in the name.

In particular for a "bootstrap-kit" I believe you should consult the official team about this. What do you think @Lerider @Johnson Zhao @Caterina Zhang(edited)

Michael Herman (Toronto) - 02/25/2018
Let's say we were trying to sell "NEO Smart Economy" 1 lb. bags of sugar on amazon.com (or a book for that matter),  how well do you think it would sell if it didn't have the word "sugar" in the product name? ...same thing.  meetup.com is a similar high-volume marketplace.(edited)
These are all community-based #doer initiatives - in all cases, individuals on their own.  We haven't even been offered anything from NEO corp or CoZ to support our efforts.  These are all self-supporting initiatives.  We're using our own personal $$$ to create these groups on meetup.com, arrange meeting space, do our own promotion, get speakers, etc.  For example, to get a few t-shirts for our YYZ and YVR kick-off meetings, I've been left to order and pay for them myself. @Lerider has offered to reimburse me in Gas.(edited)
We need to do what we can to ensure our rapid success.(edited)

Also, it's one thing how you call yourselves, another what you suggest other meetups should be called in a "bootstrap kit"
Just some well-meaning thoughts

Michael Herman (Toronto) - 02/25/2018
I'm not broadly marketing/promoting this kit... people have literally come out of the woodwork saying they want to do the same thing.  So I copy&paste, create a banner image, do a global replace, sync to github.  Two of the 4 sites have offered to do translation into Spanish and Turkish.  Can't knock something what's working.(edited)
@metachris I know ...both ways :smiley: :smiley:(edited)
As of this morning, NBT has 125 members with 95 RSVPs for the March 14 kick-off meeting. ...and we have a great local partnership with http://theblockchainhub.com/ at York Univeristy who is providing us/me with free meeting space (any size), promotion, logistical support, ...(edited)
[I tend to think about things for a long time] Imagine if someone created NEO Blockchain Tokyo on meetup, they are going to steel all of your eyeballs in a microsecond.  Don't get me wrong, I think "NEO Smart Economy" is a great tag line and great positioning ...just might not be the best brand naming strategy in a large, confusing, rapidly moving, early-adopter market where discoverability is hugely important ...unless you want to waste million$ on unnessessary (sp) promotion.(edited)

Caterina Zhang - 02/25/2018
What exactly  is the “bootstrap-kit” you mentioned? @Michael Herman (Toronto)
Actually we are aligning the visual of all marketing materials for future meetups. As long as they are recognized by Neo council, they will need to use the aligned marketing kit.

Michael Herman (Toronto) - 02/25/2018
Hi Caterina, they're a collection of files (banner image, positioning text, kickoff meeting PPT, logos, etc) - one for each meetup that enable people to create their Meetup.com site, Facebook page and Twitter account in about an hour. https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-meetupbootstrap.  Please read the discussion above if you haven't already had a chance. :smiley:
p.s. I don't actually want to be in the Meetup Kit "business", it was simply some assets I created for my own needs and shared when people asked about them ...in the same way I share and contribute software I write.(edited)

Michael Herman (Toronto) - 02/25/2018
One concept that shouldn't be overlooked: Meetup groups are like open source projects - managed by the Contributors.  Related but separate the collection of meetup kits is an MIT licensed open source project too - also managed by its Contributors.

Caterina Zhang - 02/25/2018
I see. You are free to organize the meetup in the way you like. But NEO Branding is set and cannot be changed. Branding includes the visual design, the font, the logo, the sub logo etc.
And we set strategy for neo’s global marketing. We will have standards on the visual for neo events in order to emphasize the branding awareness in the market. You are welcome to join as part of our global movement.
